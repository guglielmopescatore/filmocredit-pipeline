## Technical Architecture

### Processing Pipeline

**Phase 1: Scene Analysis**
The system employs computer vision algorithms to scan video content and identify segments likely to contain credit information. This phase utilizes motion detection, text overlay recognition, and pattern analysis to isolate relevant footage sections.

**Phase 2: Frame Extraction & Enhancement**
Representative frames are selected from identified scenes using intelligent sampling algorithms. Image enhancement techniques optimize text visibility and prepare frames for OCR processing.

**Phase 3: Text Recognition & Classification**
Azure's state-of-the-art Vision Language Model processes enhanced frames to extract textual content. The system simultaneously categorizes extracted text into structured credit information with role assignments.

**Phase 4: Validation & Code Assignment**
Extracted names undergo validation against the IMDB database. The system automatically assigns industry-standard codes and flags discrepancies for human review.
